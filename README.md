# Dynamic Inventory Management System

A C++ application that simulates an inventory management system for a small store. It uses a dynamically allocated 1D array to manage a variable number of products, allowing users to add, remove, and update product quantities interactively.

## Background
This project models a real-world inventory system where a store needs to dynamically track product quantities. It demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and array resizing in C++, reflecting scenarios where product counts change over time.

## Features
- **Add Products**: Dynamically resize the array to include new product quantities.
- **Remove Products**: Remove a product by index and resize the array accordingly.
- **Update Quantities**: Modify the quantity of a specific product.
- **Display Inventory**: View the current list of products and their quantities.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++ (Standard C++11 or later)
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` via MinGW on Windows, or any standard compiler on Linux/macOS).
- Git installed to clone the repository.
